# Search Algorithms in C

## Overview

This repository contains various search algorithms implemented in C. Search algorithms are fundamental for finding elements within data structures.

## Algorithms Included

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Jump Search
- Interpolation Search
- Exponential Search
- Advanced Binary Search
- Fibonacci Search

## Compilation

All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the following command:
\`\`\`
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic \*.c -o search
\`\`\`

## Usage

To use the search algorithms, run the compiled program with the desired parameters. For example:
\`\`\`
./search 1 34 67 78 99
\`\`\`
