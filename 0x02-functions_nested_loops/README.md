# C Language Functions and Nested Loops 📚🔄🔁

Welcome to the README for C language functions and nested loops! In this document, we will explore the basics of functions and nested loops in the C programming language, along with some helpful examples. Let's dive in! 💻🚀

## Functions 📝

In C, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions provide modularity and allow you to break down your program into smaller, manageable parts. They can take input values (parameters), perform operations, and return results.

### Function Structure 🏗️

Here's the general structure of a function in C:

```c
return_type function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
    // Function body
    // Perform operations
    // Return a value if necessary
}
```

- `return_type`: The data type of the value returned by the function. Use `void` if the function does not return any value.
- `function_name`: The name of the function. Choose a meaningful name that reflects the task it performs.
- `parameter1, parameter2, ...`: Optional input values passed to the function. Specify the data type and names.

### Example Function 🌟

Let's take a simple example of a function called `add_numbers` that adds two integers and returns the result:

```c
int add_numbers(int num1, int num2) {
    int sum = num1 + num2;
    return sum;
}
```

In this example, the function `add_numbers` takes two integer parameters (`num1` and `num2`), adds them together, and returns the sum as an integer.

## Nested Loops 🔁🔁

Nested loops in C allow you to perform repetitive tasks within another loop. They are useful for iterating over multidimensional arrays or solving complex problems that require multiple iterations.

### Loop Structure 🔃

The structure of a nested loop typically consists of an outer loop and an inner loop:

```c
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Outer loop body

    for (initialization; condition; update) {
        // Inner loop body
        // Perform operations
    }
}
```

### Example Nested Loop 🌟

Let's consider a simple example of a nested loop that prints a square pattern of asterisks:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int size = 5;

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < size; j++) {
            printf("* ");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the outer loop (`i`) controls the rows, and the inner loop (`j`) controls the columns. The result is a square pattern of asterisks printed on the screen.

## Conclusion 🎉

Functions and nested loops are fundamental concepts in the C programming language. They help in organizing code and solving complex problems efficiently. By understanding these concepts, you can write modular and structured programs. Happy coding! 😄👨‍💻
