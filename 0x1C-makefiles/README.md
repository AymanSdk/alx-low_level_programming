# CMakeFiles README

## Overview

This repository contains CMakeFiles that facilitate the build process for a project. CMake is a cross-platform build system generator that simplifies the process of compiling, configuring, and managing the build environment for software projects.

## Purpose

The CMakeFiles serve the following purposes:
- **Build Configuration**: Define how the project should be built, including compiler options, linker settings, and project structure.
- **Platform Independence**: Enable building on different platforms without modifying the build scripts extensively.
- **Dependency Management**: Manage external libraries and dependencies required by the project.
- **Modularity**: Organize the project into smaller, manageable components and libraries.

## Directory Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:
- `src/`: Contains the project's source code files.
- `include/`: Contains header files used in the project.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Main CMake configuration file.
- `lib/`: Directory for additional libraries or dependencies.
- `tests/`: Directory for project test suites or unit tests.
- `docs/`: Documentation related to the project.

## Usage

### Building the Project

1. **Create a Build Directory**:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

2. **Generate Build Files**:
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```
    This command generates the necessary build files based on the instructions in the `CMakeLists.txt` file.

3. **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    ```
    This command initiates the build process using the generated build files.

### Customizing the Build

CMake provides various options to customize the build:
- **Specifying Build Type**:
    ```bash
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
    ```
    Options: `Debug`, `Release`, `RelWithDebInfo`, `MinSizeRel`.

- **Setting Installation Directory**:
    ```bash
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install ..
    ```
    Specifies the installation directory for the built files.

- **Enabling/Disabling Features**:
    ```bash
    cmake -DENABLE_FEATURE_X=ON ..
    ```
    Allows enabling or disabling specific features within the project.
