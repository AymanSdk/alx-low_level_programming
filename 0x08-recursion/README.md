## Introduction to Recursion
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. It is based on the principle of solving a complex problem by reducing it to simpler and similar subproblems until a base case is reached.

In C, recursion is achieved by defining a function that calls itself within its own body.

## Understanding Recursive Functions
Recursive functions consist of two essential components: the base case and the recursive case.

### Base Case
The base case is a condition that determines when the recursion should stop. It defines the simplest version of the problem that does not require further recursive calls. When the base case is satisfied, the function returns a value or performs a specific action.

### Recursive Case
The recursive case defines the portion of the function where the function calls itself with modified arguments, solving a smaller subproblem. This step repeats until the base case is reached.

It is important to ensure that the recursive case eventually leads to the base case, as an infinite recursion can lead to stack overflow and crash the program.

## Examples
Let's illustrate recursion through a few examples:

### Example 1: Factorial Calculation
```c
#include <stdio.h>

unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1; // Base case: 0! = 1
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    }
}

int main() {
    unsigned int number = 5;
    unsigned int result = factorial(number);
    printf("Factorial of %d is %u\n", number, result);
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Fibonacci Sequence
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n; // Base cases: fibonacci(0) = 0, fibonacci(1) = 1
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2); // Recursive case: fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    }
}

int main() {
    int number = 7;
    int result = fibonacci(number);
    printf("Fibonacci number at position %d is %d\n", number, result);
    return 0;
}
```

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursion
Recursion has its own advantages and disadvantages:

### Advantages
- Recursive solutions can be more concise and easier to understand for certain problems.
- It can effectively solve problems that exhibit a recursive structure, such as tree traversal or divide-and-conquer algorithms.
- Recursive solutions often mimic the problem's natural structure, making the code more intuitive.

### Disadvantages
- Recursive functions tend to use more memory compared to iterative solutions because each function call adds a new frame to the call stack.
- If not implemented correctly, recursion can lead to infinite loops or excessive function calls, resulting in poor performance or stack overflow errors.
- Recursive solutions may not be the most efficient approach for some problems, especially when an iterative solution can be simpler and
