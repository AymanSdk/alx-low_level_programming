# Dynamic Libraries (Shared Libraries) - README

## Overview

Dynamic libraries, also known as shared libraries, are a fundamental concept in modern software development. They provide a way to share code and resources among multiple programs, leading to more efficient memory usage and code maintenance. This README provides an overview of dynamic libraries, their advantages, and how to work with them in C programming.

## What Are Dynamic Libraries?

Dynamic libraries (or shared libraries) are files containing compiled code and data that can be used by multiple programs simultaneously at runtime. Unlike static libraries, which are linked with a program at compile time and become part of the executable, dynamic libraries are loaded into memory only when needed by a program. They are identified by file extensions such as ".so" on Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux) or ".dll" on Windows.

## Advantages of Dynamic Libraries

Using dynamic libraries offers several advantages:

1. **Code Reusability:** Multiple programs can share the same library code, reducing redundancy and making updates easier.

2. **Smaller Executables:** Dynamic libraries are loaded into memory only when needed, resulting in smaller executable file sizes.

3. **Easier Maintenance:** Updates to a dynamic library benefit all programs that use it, simplifying maintenance.

4. **Version Control:** Libraries can have multiple versions, allowing programs to specify which version they require.

5. **Efficient Memory Usage:** Libraries are shared in memory among programs, reducing memory consumption.

## Working with Dynamic Libraries in C

To work with dynamic libraries in C:

### Building Dynamic Libraries

1. **Write Library Code:** Develop functions, data, and resources that you want to share in a dynamic library.

2. **Compile:** Compile the library code into a dynamic library file (e.g., `.so` on Linux, `.dll` on Windows). Use appropriate compiler flags and options.

### Using Dynamic Libraries

1. **Include Headers:** In your program, include the header files associated with the dynamic library. These headers declare the functions and symbols provided by the library.

2. **Linking:** During compilation, specify the dynamic library's name and path using appropriate compiler/linker flags. This informs the linker about the library's location.

3. **Runtime Loading:** At runtime, the operating system's dynamic linker/loader loads the required dynamic libraries into memory.

4. **Calling Library Functions:** You can call functions provided by the dynamic library as if they were part of your program.

### Tips and Best Practices

- Ensure the dynamic library's interface (function prototypes, data structures) remains stable to avoid breaking existing programs.

- Follow naming conventions and versioning strategies for dynamic libraries to manage compatibility and updates.

- Use tools like `ldconfig` (on Linux) to manage library paths and configurations.
