# ile I/O in C Language

File Input/Output (I/O) is a crucial aspect of programming, enabling the reading and writing of data to and from files. This repository provides a comprehensive guide to performing File I/O operations using the C programming language.

## Introduction to File I/O

File Input/Output (I/O) operations are fundamental for interacting with files on a computer's storage. These operations involve tasks such as reading data from files, writing data to files, and manipulating file contents. In C, File I/O is facilitated through a set of functions and modes provided by the standard library.

## Getting Started

To start using File I/O in your C programs, follow these steps:

1. **Include the necessary header file:** Include the `<stdio.h>` header file in your program. This header file provides the required functions and constants for performing File I/O operations.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

2. **Open the file:** Use the `fopen()` function to open a file. This function returns a file pointer that you'll use for subsequent operations.

```c
FILE *file_ptr = fopen("filename.txt", "mode");
```

3. **Perform operations:** Use various File I/O functions to read from or write to the opened file. These functions include `fgetc()`, `fputc()`, `fgets()`, `fputs()`, `fprintf()`, `fscanf()`, and more.

4. **Close the file:** After you're done with the file, make sure to close it using the `fclose()` function.

```c
fclose(file_ptr);
```

## File Modes

When opening a file using the `fopen()` function, you must specify a mode that defines the type of operations you intend to perform on the file. Some common file modes include:

- `"r"`: Read mode. Opens the file for reading.
- `"w"`: Write mode. Opens the file for writing. Creates a new file if it doesn't exist or truncates the file if it does.
- `"a"`: Append mode. Opens the file for writing, but appends data at the end instead of truncating.
- `"rb"` and `"wb"`: Binary read and write modes, respectively.
- `"a+"`: Read and append mode.

## File I/O Functions

The C standard library provides several functions for File I/O operations:

- `fopen()`: Opens a file and returns a file pointer.
- `fclose()`: Closes a file.
- `fgetc()`: Reads a character from a file.
- `fputc()`: Writes a character to a file.
- `fgets()`: Reads a string from a file.
- `fputs()`: Writes a string to a file.
- `fprintf()`: Writes formatted output to a file.
- `fscanf()`: Reads formatted input from a file.

## Examples
